Using Python (2.7) and SQL to predict the results of the NCAA basketball tourney.

I used Sublime Text 2 to develop this project. If you use it, you should purchase the license (https://www.sublimetext.com/buy?v=3).

mySQLdb is required to use loadData, a core method. SQLAlchemy is also used in this project; download and donate (http://www.sqlalchemy.org/).

The data is from basketball-reference, the basketball-related portion of a cool sports statistics site. I highly reccomend it for projects using sports statistics

I used Python 2.7 on this project. It is highly likely you will have problems using any files on this repository running Python 3.

Feel free to contact me, and enjoy!
